## Overview 
A calm, colorful moment. Made for the No Words Jam using Godot 4, Modulate is a journey for the senses. 

## Controls 
- Arrows or WASD to move, space to jump.

Controls originally not provided for Jam submission, but here we are now.

## Objective 
Traverse the level, see the sights, hear the sounds, collect the cubes.

## Closing remarks
- Modulate represents a prototype as made in a week for the No Words Jam!
- Implementations and features are not final, I'd love to work on this more in time!
